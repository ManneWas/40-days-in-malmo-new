currently, working tested definition of location is as follows:  
  
 file name will be name of object so no need to set it as a field.  
"field_name_1":"field_value_1"  
"field_name_2":"field_value_2"  
"array_name":  
- [[array_item_1]]
- [[array_item_2]]
- [[array_item_3]]
- [[array_item_4]]
- [[array_item_5]]
